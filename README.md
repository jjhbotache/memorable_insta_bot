# Memorable Insta Bot

## Description
This is a very interesting project, as it is a bot that follows the followers of an Instagram account. Given some target accounts, the bot follows the followers of these accounts, with a criteria that can be configured. Since Instagram has certain restrictions, the bot randomly goes through the instagram feed and also looks at it with criteria, ignoring content that does not meet the criteria. The criteria are evaluated by AI, to have a personalized feed and follow suitable accounts.
